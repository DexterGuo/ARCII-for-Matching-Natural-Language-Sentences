## Quick Glance
1. Input Data Format
* Train set:
```
label	|q1	|q2<br>
1	|Amrozi accused his brother, whom he called "the witness", of deliberately distorting his evidence.	|Referring to him as only "the witness", Amrozi accused his brother of deliberately distorting his evidence.<br>
0	|Yucaipa owned Dominick's before selling the chain to Safeway in 1998 for $2.5 billion.	|Yucaipa bought Dominick's in 1995 for $693 million and sold it to Safeway for $1.8 billion in 1998.<br>
```

* Test set:
```
